Create unlimited maps with custom icon markers and infowindows for free. Furthermore, this plugin does not require API Key to work.

== Description ==
In shorts, with this plugin you can :
- Create as many maps as you wish
- Create multiple location points on each map
- Change location point's marker with custom icon
- Change info window content with any HTML
- Put the map into your website and not worry about 20k free limitation. It stays free.

#### Motivation

I created this plugin because I'm not satisfied with the current free maps solutions. Either it is too complicated to create a map, or it forces us to pay for PRO version just to get simple things work. Therefore, this specific plugin is meant to provide you with simple mapping solutions that works for free and unlimited.
